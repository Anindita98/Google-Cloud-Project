# Google-Cloud-Project
A Python-based cloud data pipeline for Gans , an imaginary e-scooter startup. It uses Google Cloud Functions, Scheduler, APIs, and web scraping to automate the collection, processing, and storage of weather, city, flight, and airport data, storing the results in a database to optimize city operations.
## Summary
This project focuses on building a cloud-based data pipeline using Google Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler, and external APIs. The pipeline automates the process of collecting, processing, and storing data related to weather, city demographics, flight information, and airport details. The collected data is then stored in a MySQL database on the cloud. This project highlights the use of serverless architecture and cloud services for automating data management tasks.
## Languages and Libraries Used
Languages: Python Libraries: requests for making API calls pandas for data manipulation and storage sqlalchemy for database connection and management pytz for handling timezones MySQL for database management on Google Cloud Cloud Services: Google Cloud Functions for serverless execution of Python scripts Google Cloud Scheduler for automating the execution of cloud functions Google Cloud SQL for data storage APIs: OpenWeatherMap API for weather data API Ninjas City API for city information Aerodatabox API for flight and airport information
## Key Learnings
Cloud Automation: Learned how to set up automated tasks on Google Cloud using Cloud Functions and Cloud Scheduler. API Integration: Practiced integrating multiple external APIs for collecting diverse data sets, including weather, city, flight, and airport data. Data Handling and Storage: Improved skills in handling large datasets with Python's pandas library and efficiently storing them in a cloud-based MySQL database. Serverless Architecture: Gained experience in deploying Python functions in a serverless environment, which is scalable and cost-effective. Beyond technical skills, I honed my ability to design solutions for real-world data problems and communicate the workflow and architecture effectively.
## Challenges Overcame
API Rate Limits: I encountered rate limits while pulling data from multiple APIs. I resolved this by optimizing the API call frequency and batching requests more efficiently. Timezones and Data Synchronization: Managing timezones across various API data sources was challenging. I resolved this by using the pytz library to standardize all time-related data to the Berlin timezone. Cloud SQL Connectivity: I faced issues connecting to the MySQL database hosted on Google Cloud initially due to incorrect firewall settings. I resolved this by adjusting the Cloud SQL settings to allow connections from my cloud functions.
## Database Setup
The SQL script for setting up the MySQL database can be found in the create_database.sql file. This script creates the necessary tables for storing city, weather, airport, and flight data. To execute the script:
Connect to your MySQL server.
Run the create_database.sql script to create the Gans database and all the required tables.
## Additional Reflections
This project provided a comprehensive understanding of how to build cloud-native applications using serverless technologies. The flexibility and scalability of Google Cloud services made it possible to automate tasks that would otherwise require manual execution. Additionally, integrating multiple APIs and handling real-time data in a cloud environment simulated the kind of projects I'd work on in a professional data science role
